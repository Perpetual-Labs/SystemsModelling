### Name: JuliaSim
### Summary:
 - JuliaSim, a high-performance programming environment designed to blend traditional modeling and simulation with machine learning. JuliaSim can build accelerated [[surrogates]] from component-based models, such as those conforming to the FMI standard ([[FMU]]), using continuous-time echo state networks ([[CTESN]]).
 -  JuliaSim â€” a modeling and simulation environment, which merges elements of acausal modeling frameworks like [[Modelica]] with machine learning elements.
- The foundation of this environment, [[ModelingToolkit.jl]], is an acausal modeling language which can compose the trained surrogates as components within its staged compilation process.
