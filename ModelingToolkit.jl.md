### Name: ModelingToolkit.jl

> ModelingToolkit.jl [[ma--21a]] (MTK) is a framework for equation-based acausal modeling written in the Julia programming language (Bezanson et al. 2017), which generates large systems of [[DAE]]s from symbolic models. Similarly to [[Modelica language]], it allows for building models hierarchically in a component-based fashion.
### Summary:
ModelingToolkit.jl is a modeling framework for high-performance symbolic-numeric computation in scientific computing and scientific machine learning. It allows for users to give a high-level description of a model for symbolic preprocessing to analyze and enhance the model. ModelingToolkit can automatically generate fast functions for model components like Jacobians and Hessians, along with automatically sparsifying and parallelizing the computations. Automatic transformations, such as index reduction, can be applied to the model to make it easier for numerical solvers to handle.
-  ModelingToolkit.jl , presented in [[ma--21a]], an acausal modeling framework with an interactive compilation mechanism for including exact and inexact transformations.
