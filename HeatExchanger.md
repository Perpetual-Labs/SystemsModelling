# Heat-Exchanger

- This is the system of interest of the #MBQP project. 
- Our goal is to simulate a system integrating an Heat-exchanger in #Modelica. 	
	-	The first step is to integrate a #CFD analysis in Modelica as an [[FMU]]
	-	The second step is to integrate a [[surrogate model]] trained using [[Dakota]]
