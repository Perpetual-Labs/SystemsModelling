### Notes
-
he #MBQP project. 
- Our goal is to simulate a system, an [[ECS]], integrating, an Heat-exchanger in [[Modelica language]]. 	
	-	The first step is to integrate a #CFD analysis in Modelica as an [[FMU]]
	-	The second step is to integrate a [[surrogate model]] trained using [[Dakota]]  
- The idea is to implement a [simplified [[ECS]]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SZbT4-KJRGg5PQjVfKXZ-fCaWbSgWP5a/view?usp=sharing) referencing the one described in [[jenn20a]]. This could be simulated at the flight conditions described in [[müll07a]].
