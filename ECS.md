# Environmental Control System

The Environmental Control System (ECS) is the system responsible for performing a great number of tasks, including pressurizing and ventilating the cabin, controlling the pressure and temperature onboard.

This is investigated in [[poud19a]]  [[jenn20a]].

For demonstating the potential of our method in the context of #MBQP, we are going to create a simplified version of ECS in [[Modelica language]]. A graphical representation of our system can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SZbT4-KJRGg5PQjVfKXZ-fCaWbSgWP5a/view?usp=sharing).
