This paper shows the implementation of [[ ModelingToolkit.jl]]. This is a library in #Julia. It seems to replace #Modelica. Morever, it makes use of #MachineLearning techniques to reduce the computational burden. 

Of particular interest is the #CTESN surrogate modeling technque which aims at catcing the behaviour of a phenomenon with respect of time (similarly to #Manifold  #DMD). To catch the dependence with respect to the other parameters it uses #RadialBasisFunctions.
