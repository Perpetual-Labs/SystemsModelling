### Notes
- C. Muller et al. employed FLECS to conduct a dynamic simulation of the [[ECS]], focusing primarily on the response characterises of the trim values within the air distribution ducts for a range of cabin target temperatures. 
- For Verification and Validation (V&V), temperature readings based on the flight test of an A340-600 at the inlet of the supply duct, inlet of the cabin, and at two different cabin zones, were used. In terms of the PACK performance characteristics, only mass flow at PACK outlet was simulated to support target temperature adjustment.
- They test the simulation model at different conditions
